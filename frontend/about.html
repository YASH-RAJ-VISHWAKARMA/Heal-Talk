          <p>
            "Heal Talk was born from a simple belief — no one should feel alone
            in their toughest moments. Technology should not only solve
            problems, it should touch hearts. This chatbot is our effort to
            bring comfort, understanding, and emotional support to anyone who
            needs a safe space to talk. If Heal Talk becomes even a small light
            in someone’s dark day, we have succeeded."

          <h2>Our History</h2>
          <p>
            Heal Talk was created with a simple goal — to provide emotional
            support through technology. The idea started when the creators
            realized that many people feel unheard, even with so many digital
            tools around. So, they built an AI chatbot that understands
            emotions, not just words. What began as a small college project soon
            grew into a meaningful wellbeing tool. With improved emotion
            detection, comforting responses, and a calm interface, Heal Talk
            became a safe space for people to express their feelings anytime.
            Today, Heal Talk stands as a reminder that technology can care,
            listen, and help heal — one conversation at a time.
